                <h3>CodeBounty</h3>
                <p>An ongoing project, I am working with a team of computer science students to create an Open Source
		    Project sharing website. 

		    I have developed both frontend and backend code, from intergrating a mySql database and server side code 
		    with Go to a user interface with TypeScript and React

		    Tools and skills I have used on this project include: 
                </p>
		<ul> 
		    <li>Go programming language with the Gin web framework</li> 
		    <li>SQL, mySQL</li> 
		    <li>Collaboritve programming using Git</li> 
		    <li>React</li>

		<h3>Wikipedia Link Connecter</h3>
		<p> This project was written in C as an exercise for myself to apply a graph theory to a programming project. 
		    When two links are inputed into the program, it searches through the link of the starting 
		    page and continues to search through links on the page and further pages until it finds the second link. 
		    Tools and skills include: 
		</p> 
		<ul> 
		    <li>Breadth first search</li> 
		    <li>Web crawling and scraping</li>
